Write a command to initiate 2 replicas in a replica set "rs1"


For example, you can start two MongoDB instances on different ports:
mongod --port 27017 --replSet rs1 --dbpath /data/db1
mongod --port 27018 --replSet rs1 --dbpath /data/db2

Connect to One of the Instances Using mongo Shell: You can connect to the primary instance (typically the first one you started).
mongo --port 27017


Initiate the Replica Set: Use the rs.initiate() command to initiate the replica set with the configuration for two members.

MongoDB Command to Initiate a Replica Set 
rs.initiate(
  {
    _id: "rs1",  // Replica set name
    members: [   // Members of the replica set
      { _id: 0, host: "localhost:27017" },  // First member (primary)
      { _id: 1, host: "localhost:27018" }   // Second member (secondary)
    ]
  }
);
