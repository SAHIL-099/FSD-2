Consider following student collection:
[
 {_id:123433,name: "SSS",age:22},
 {_id:123434,name: "YYY",age:2},
 {_id:123435,name: "PPP",age:32},
]
Do as directed:
(1) Update name=”JJJ” and age=40, where age=20 occurs. Insert new document, if record is not 
found.

-->db.student.updateMany({age:20},{$set:{name:"JJJ",age:40}},upsert:true)

(2) To retrieve age and name fields of documents having names “YYY” & “SSS”. Don’t project _id 
field.

-->db.student.find({name:{$in:["YYY","SSS"]}},{age:1,name:1})
