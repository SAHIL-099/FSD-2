Consider collection named “movie” having documents like this:
[
 {"title": "Inception", "director": "Christopher Nolan", "release_year": 2010},
 {"title": "The Matrix", "director": "The Wachowskis", "release_year": 1999},
 {"title": "The Avengers", "director": "Joss Whedon", "release_year": 2012,}
]
Do as directed:
(1) Create a subset-based index that includes only movies released after the year 2000. Specify the 
field or condition used in the subset. Additionally, write a command to get a scan stage = 
“IXSCAN” for movie released after the year 2000 and give the values of nReturned and 
docExamined.

-->db.movie.createIndex(
  { release_year: 1 },
  { partialFilterExpression: { release_year: { $gt: 2000 } } }
);

-->db.movie.find({ release_year: { $gt: 2000 } }).explain("executionStats");



(2) Generate indexing on director and release_year. Additionally, write a command to get movie 
released on or before the year 2010 and give the values of nReturned, docExamined and its scan 
stage.

---> db.movie.createIndex({ director: 1, release_year: 1 });
-->db.movie.find({ release_year: { $lte: 2010 } }).explain("executionStats");
