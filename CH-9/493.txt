# (3)SELECT * FROM USER WHERE status != "A"


(1)SELECT * FROM USER WHERE status = "A" ORDER BY age DESC
-->db.USER.find({status:''A}).sort({age:-1})


(2)UPDATE USER SET age = age + 3 WHERE status = "A"
-->db.USER.updateMany({status:'A},{$set:{inc:{age:3}}})


(3)SELECT * FROM USER WHERE status != "A"
-->db.USER.find({status:{$ne:'A'}})
